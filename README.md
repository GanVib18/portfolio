## 💼 Experience

### Data Scientist (Part-Time Consultant) — British Columbia Lottery Corporation
*Jan 2025 – Nov 2025*

Led end-to-end development and enterprise-wide deployment of advanced analytics solutions at BCLC's Advanced Analytics division.

- **Player Segmentation:** Developed a behavioral segmentation model using Discrete-Time Markov Chains, deployed to the Player Rewards program — identified **$400K/week in incentive inefficiencies** and enabled capital reallocation.
- **Customer Lifetime Value:** Co-built a CLV model that improved revenue forecasting accuracy by **20%**; operationalized via Snowflake to optimize a multi-million-dollar player journey budget.
- Served as a thought leader in the AI & Data Science Community of Practice (COP), publishing articles and presenting to champion ML adoption across the business.

### Data Science Research Assistant — SFU MAGPIE Group
*Jan 2023 – Dec 2023*

- Built a multi-source COVID-19 dataset spanning 130+ metrics; applied ML (random forest, gradient boosting, hierarchical clustering) to model Omicron variant evolution.
- Presented findings at the **31st International Dynamics & Evolution of Human Viruses** conference; contributed to an upcoming publication.

### Data Analyst — BC Public Service: Ministry of Health
*Jan 2023 – Apr 2023*

- Built Oracle-to-Power BI data pipelines for real-time physician shift reporting; created dynamic dashboards with drill-down maps and time-series charts.
- Resolved data discrepancies in collaboration with the policy team, achieving a **15% reduction in reporting errors**.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Bayesian Media Mix Modelling for Global Marketing Attribution](https://github.com/GanVib18/Bayesian-Media-Mix-Model)
`PyMC` `Bayesian Inference` `SciPy Optimisation` `Hierarchical Modelling` · [▶ Read the Article](https://medium.com/@gandhivibhuti1802/building-a-bayesian-media-mix-model-from-scratch-af14a2e4485b)

Built a full-stack MMM pipeline for a fictional outdoor apparel brand across five markets. Generated synthetic data with known ground truth, applied geometric adstock and Hill saturation transformations, and fit a hierarchical Bayesian model to decompose revenue by channel. A SciPy budget optimizer identified a consistent reallocation from Social → Paid Search yielding an **8–15% weekly revenue uplift** across all regions.

### [Regime-Switching Portfolio Optimisation with Hidden Markov Models](https://github.com/GanVib18/Regime-Switching-Asset-Allocation)
`Gaussian HMM` `Ledoit-Wolf Shrinkage` `Walk-Forward Validation` `Canadian ETFs` · [▶ Read the Article](https://medium.com/@gandhivibhuti1802/smarter-than-60-40-building-a-regime-switching-portfolio-with-machine-learning-b6c1172b84f5)

Built a three-regime market detection system using a Gaussian HMM on 10 engineered features (realized volatility, momentum, credit spread proxy, yield curve slope), combined with mean-variance optimization. Achieved a **Sharpe ratio of 1.27 vs. 0.88** for a 60/40 benchmark, outperforming in 3 of 4 out-of-sample test periods.
