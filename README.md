In the project I study model performance of Binary Classification models and Support Vector Machines by utilizing the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. I developed, fine-tuned and evaluated predictive models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with an RBF kernel.
